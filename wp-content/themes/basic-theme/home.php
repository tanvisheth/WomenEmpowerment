		<p> Women empowerment has become one of the biggest movements in India nowadays and many 
		Indian women have proven to be the building blocks of the movement. With their pure passion 
		for their work and their good deeds, they are very well a true inspiration for everyone.
		</p>
		
		<p> Most of them are known and respected throughout the world and some of them are historical 
		figures and most definitely, all of them will be remembered forever. I myself take a lot of 
		inspiration from these empowering women and want each and every woman in the world to know about 
		them and be inspired by them.</p>
		
		<p> These 7 women are truly role models for every woman in the world and we can all learn a lot 
		from them (Yes! Even the men). 
		So, without further delay, letâ€™s get started with the list. To se the list click on the following
